# ColorLab

ColorLab is a web application designed to provide data-driven, scientific 
tools for developers, designers and artists to create color palettes.

Through using CIELAB colorspace to make calculations, the resulting color
palettes are built with human biology in mind.

Consideration for the way in which a color palette is viewed is essential for
providing enough context for the user to make decisions. ColorLab considers
the relativisic nature of color as a human experience when displaying colors to
users.
